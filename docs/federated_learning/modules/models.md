# Collection of models

Well-defined models that are used in the applications are stored here. It can either be a .py script or a trained model with extension of .pt.

This folder is used for baseline models whose parameter values are not trained to its best. The well trained ones for each application are stored in the checkpoint folder under the specific application.
